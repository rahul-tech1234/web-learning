      You get dignity,<br />
      When you stop thinking wrong <br />When you do what you learn right
    </p>
    <p>
      You can live dignified, <br />When you live a lifestyle that,
      <br />matches your vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can get dignity <br />when you renounce the “ego of individuality”.
      <br />and rejoice ups and downs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is dignity,<br />
      when you have good thoughts,<br />
      in your heart and mind. <br />-Manasvi Mehra, 13 years Gwalior

    <h2>Dignity</h2>
    <h4>
      Dignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them.

    <p>Summer</p>
    <p>
      The warmth on my skin,<br />
      The heat on my face, <br />Humidity in the air, <br />The sweat after a
      race.<br />
      Longer days with fun and joy,<br />
      Is what summer brings. <br />The sky in a brilliant shade of blue,<br />
      And so many more things. <br />The cold, tingling feeling of the pool,
      <br />As our skin gives a sigh of relief. <br />Our minds thinking of the
      lazy days, <br />When nobody is in grief.<br />
      The sun shines merrily above the horizon,<br />
      Sharing its heat and light.<br />
      A smile on everybody’s face, As our hearts are filled with delight!

    <p>Life of an Ant and a Spider</p>
    <p>
      Behind the bush, upon the mound,<br />
      ants are moving without a sound. <br />Leaves are passed along the chain,
      <br />where ants are lined as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strands of silver make its net,<br />
      a fly is caught in its web;<br />
      Now it’s too late,<br />
      the spider comes to seal its fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They march on to feed the queen, <br />deep below she lays unseen.<br />
      Workers feed the silent drones,<br />
      in their capsule breeding zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spider shoots its webs to reach,<br />
      across the ever-widening breach. <br />Swinging on a single thread,<br />
      beyond the gap, the web is spread

    <p>Rainbow Family Pleasantness</p>
    <p>
      One day came a long, serene rain, <br />Saplings, plants, farmers,
      reservoirs smiled again.<br />
      Others gave a frown of pain, <br />Due to foresight, there was no stink or
      overflowing drains. <br />Then arose the shining sun, <br />It was
      curtains up for a boon.<br />
      I looked up with elegant smile, <br />Sweet rainbow appeared within a
      mile. <br />I met the rainbow at the horizon, <br />It was a joyful,
      lovely reunion. S. Miracle
